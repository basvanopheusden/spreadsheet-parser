We are a leading provider of ERP solution to Electrical, Plumbing and HVAC industry. Ximple Solutions covers a full range of business requirements including sales, purchase, finance, accounting, inventory control, customer relationship management, warehouse management, and specialized needs of our clients. Our Vision Ximple intelligent ERP innovation roadmap includes a mix of artificial intelligence and machine learning with a focus on user experience, cloud and the internet of things (IoT) that will support broader global digital business models. We plan to transform ERP software from a system of records to a system of engagement, intelligence, and ultimately a system of decisions.  Currently, most of the ERP software are stuck with the system of records and this reality is with legacy systems that aren‚Äôt correctly built for easy integration and they slow down the digital transformation. To make it worse there is still quite a lot of manual data entry going on. Today everyone expects the same ease of use from enterprise applications as they do from any other solution. It needs to be intuitive, easy and user-centric or it simply won‚Äôt be used at all.  We need to take user experience into account and even put it front and center, combined with a mobile-first approach and soon the new types of interfaces enabling to interact with  Natural Language Processing as part of the enabling mix. A whopping 85% plus percent of ERP users would abandon enterprise software for disconnected spreadsheets, defeating the purpose of an enterprise application, when confronted with poor software usability. The role of the customer experience and user experience can‚Äôt be underestimated in any system or application nowadays. In short, gone are the days that IT is decided on a network and users simply had to use it. Currently, there isn‚Äôt a lot of intelligent ERP and integration of IoT, massive data analytics, cognitive and process automation, let alone autonomous processes and decisions going on yet.  Digital transformation is about information, people, experiences, speed, timing, convenience, operations, automation and interconnectedness/collaboration. Intelligent ERP is a system of integration ‚Äì connecting with other applications for advanced end-to-end business process automation. Intelligent ERP on the most basic level as the ERP becoming a system of engagement, a method of insight and intelligence, a system of decisions and system of integration and connectivity instead of just a system of records. ERP applications fulfill so many tasks in business process optimization in areas such as order management and processing, in data collection, in planning on an enterprise production level and hooking up with other systems (HR, invoice processing and accounting, shipping, warehouse management, CRM, materials management, procurement and supplier management and so on), the far-reaching possibilities of intelligent ERP become all the more precise and vast. This is especially so if we add that inherent technological dimension of ‚Äòintelligence‚Äô to it, which among others, refers to components such as predictive analytics, machine learning and autonomous decisions and actions. The state and future of intelligent ERP as the Industry 4.0 autonomous decision center on the business process level.

While digital technologies are rapidly transforming both business practices and societies and are integral to the innovation-driven economies of the future, they are also the core driver of the great economic paradox of their time. On one hand, productivity, wealth, and profits are each at record highs; on the other hand, the median worker in America is poorer than in 1997, and fewer people have jobs. Rapid advances in technology are creating unprecedented benefits and efficiencies, but there is no economic law that says everyone, or even a majority of people, will share in these gains.  Technology is advancing quickly, but organizations and skills advance slowly. What‚Äôs more, the gap between swiftly evolving technology and the slower pace of human development will grow rapidly in the coming decades, as exponential improvements in artificial intelligence, robotics, networks, analytics, and digitization affect more and more of the economy and society.

As the AI gets more accurate, so do the labels, so the annotation team can generate more labels faster than ever. The custom AI also drives our active learning system that automatically finds objects buried in hours of video and queues up the frames for the team to check.

Finally, integrated dataset management and data science tools allow data scientists to run experiments and validate the dataset by training inference models in parallel with the labeling effort.

Today, training a computer vision model can take months of multiple cycles of labeling, exporting, training a model, analyzing the results, and starting again to achieve success.
